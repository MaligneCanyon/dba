- need to alter the schema of table 'todos', so that todo items are autom'ly
deleted if the corresponding list is deleted

- in the schema.sql file
CREATE TABLE todos (
  ...
  list_id int NOT NULL REFERENCES lists (id)
);

becomes
CREATE TABLE todos (
  ...
  list_id int NOT NULL REFERENCES lists (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

- rather than recreating the db, can just add the constraint to the table
  - first, drop the existing constraint
    ALTER TABLE todos DROP CONSTRAINT todos_list_id_fkey;
  - then re-add it (w/ the ON DELETE CASCADE condition)
    ALTER TABLE todos ADD FOREIGN KEY (list_id) REFERENCES lists (id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
